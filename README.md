# üéµ **Global Beats: A Cloud-Native Spotify Data Engineering Pipeline**

## üöÄ Overview

**Global Beats** is a fully automated, cloud-native data engineering pipeline that ingests, processes, and analyzes the world's top 50 Spotify tracks daily. Leveraging the power of AWS, Apache Spark, Airflow, and Redshift, this project demonstrates how to build a scalable, production-ready ETL system for real-time music analytics.

## üéØ **Project Highlights**

- **Automated Orchestration:**  
  Apache Airflow orchestrates the entire pipeline, scheduling daily data pulls, triggering AWS Lambda for extraction, and managing downstream ETL jobs.

- **Serverless Extraction:**  
  AWS Lambda fetches the latest Top 50 Global tracks, artists, and albums from the Spotify API, storing raw JSON in S3 for durability and scalability.

- **Schema Discovery & Cataloging:**  
  AWS Glue Crawlers automatically infer schema and update the Glue Data Catalog, enabling seamless data discovery and governance.

- **Distributed Transformation:**  
  AWS Glue ETL jobs, powered by Apache Spark, clean, normalize, and enrich the data at scale, handling complex transformations and joining with historical datasets.

- **Data Warehousing:**  
  Transformed data is loaded into Amazon Redshift, providing a high-performance, scalable analytics warehouse for deep dives and BI reporting.

- **Ad-hoc Analytics:**  
  Amazon Athena enables instant SQL queries on both raw and processed data in S3, supporting rapid prototyping and data exploration.

- **Monitoring & Logging:**  
  CloudWatch tracks pipeline health, logs, and metrics, with alerts for failures or anomalies.

- **Visualization Ready:**  
  Data is structured for direct consumption by BI tools like Tableau, PowerBI, or AWS QuickSight, enabling rich dashboards and insights.

## üì¶ **How It Works**

### 1. **Extraction (Airflow + Lambda)**
Airflow triggers a Lambda function daily, which authenticates with the Spotify API and downloads the latest Top 50 Global tracks, artists, and albums. The raw data is stored in S3 with timestamped folders for versioning.

### 2. **Schema Discovery (Glue Crawler)**
Glue Crawlers scan the S3 bucket, infer the schema, and update the Glue Data Catalog, making the data queryable and discoverable.

### 3. **Transformation (Glue ETL + Spark)**
Glue ETL jobs (written in PySpark) clean, normalize, and enrich the data. This includes deduplication, type casting, flattening nested structures, and joining with historical data for trend analysis.

### 4. **Loading (Redshift)**
The processed data is loaded into Amazon Redshift using the COPY command, optimized for analytics and BI workloads.

### 5. **Analytics (Athena & Redshift)**
Analysts can run ad-hoc SQL queries using Athena directly on S3 or leverage Redshift for complex, large-scale analytics.

### 6. **Visualization**
Data is ready for visualization in Tableau, PowerBI, or AWS QuickSight, enabling real-time dashboards and insights into global music trends.
